In the ever - evolving landscape of computing, the exponential growth of data - intensive applications, such as artificial intelligence, big data analytics, and cloud - based services, has imposed unprecedented demands on memory systems. Traditional single - tier memory architectures, predominantly relying on Dynamic Random - Access Memory (DRAM), are struggling to keep pace with these escalating requirements. The limitations of DRAM, including its relatively high cost per bit, limited capacity scalability, and energy inefficiencies, have become significant bottlenecks in achieving high - performance and cost - effective computing solutions [1, 2].

To address these challenges, multi - tiered memory systems have emerged as a promising alternative. These systems integrate different types of memory, each with distinct characteristics in terms of access latency, capacity, and cost, into a hierarchical structure. At the lower levels, fast but expensive DRAM provides low - latency access for frequently used data, ensuring quick response times for critical operations. In the middle or upper levels, Non - Volatile Memory (NVM) or other emerging memory technologies offer higher capacity at a lower cost per bit, albeit with higher access latencies. This hierarchical arrangement allows for a more efficient utilization of memory resources, matching the specific requirements of different applications and data access patterns.

Among the various components in multi - tiered memory systems, Compute Express Link (CXL) memory has gained significant attention. CXL is an open - standard interconnect protocol that enables direct and cache - coherent access to remote memory resources. This technology offers several key advantages in the context of modern computing. Firstly, it provides high - bandwidth communication between the CPU and memory devices, which is crucial for applications that require rapid data transfer, such as in - memory databases and large - scale data processing. Secondly, CXL memory supports features like memory pooling and sharing, allowing for more flexible resource allocation across multiple computing nodes. This is particularly beneficial in virtualized environments, where multiple virtual machines (VMs) need to access and share memory resources efficiently. Additionally, CXL's cache - coherence mechanism ensures data consistency across different memory tiers, reducing the complexity of memory management and enhancing the overall system performance [3, 4].

Tiered memory management encompasses a range of techniques and strategies designed to optimize the utilization of different memory tiers. Page placement is a critical aspect, which involves determining the most appropriate memory tier for each page based on its access frequency and data characteristics. For example, hot pages, which are accessed frequently, are typically placed in DRAM to minimize access latency, while cold pages can be migrated to higher - latency, lower - cost memory tiers. Page migration is another important component, enabling the movement of pages between different memory tiers as the access patterns of applications change over time. This helps to balance the load across the memory hierarchy and improve the overall system performance. Moreover, memory management also includes considerations such as cache management, memory allocation, and deallocation to ensure efficient resource utilization.

However, when it comes to applying tiered memory systems in virtualized environments, several challenges remain unresolved. One of the primary issues is the complexity of managing cache coherence across multiple virtual machines and different memory tiers. In a virtualized setting, multiple VMs share the physical memory resources, and maintaining cache coherence becomes more intricate. Ensuring that all VMs have consistent views of the data in different memory tiers without incurring excessive overhead is a significant challenge. Existing cache - coherence protocols often struggle to scale effectively in such multi - tenant environments, leading to potential data inconsistencies and performance degradation.

Another challenge lies in the efficient handling of memory access latency differences. The performance of VMs can be severely affected by the variable access latencies of different memory tiers. As applications running on VMs have diverse memory access patterns, it is difficult to predict and optimize for these latency variations. For instance, some applications may experience a high number of cache misses when accessing data from remote memory tiers, leading to increased processing delays. Developing intelligent algorithms and techniques that can adapt to these latency differences in real - time and optimize memory access for each VM is crucial but remains an open problem.

Furthermore, the dynamic nature of virtualized environments, where the number of VMs and their resource requirements can change rapidly, poses challenges for effective memory management. Allocating and deallocating memory resources in a timely and fair manner among multiple VMs while considering the characteristics of different memory tiers is a complex task. Ensuring that each VM receives an appropriate share of memory resources based on its workload demands without causing resource contention or under - utilization is essential for the overall performance and stability of the virtualized system.

In this paper, we delve into the intricacies of tiered memory management in virtualized environments, with a particular focus on leveraging the capabilities of CXL memory. We aim to explore solutions to the existing challenges and propose novel strategies to enhance the performance and efficiency of virtualized multi - tiered memory systems. By addressing these issues, we seek to provide valuable insights and practical solutions for the design and implementation of more robust and efficient memory management systems in the virtualized computing paradigm.
